  <h1>Royal Hokm - Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2025-01-01</p>

  <h2>Who we are</h2>
  <p>
    Royal Hokm is a mobile game developed by <strong>Behnam / Hokm Studio</strong>
    ("we", "us", or "our"). This privacy policy explains how we handle information
    when you use the Royal Hokm game.
  </p>

  <h2>Information we collect</h2>
  <p>Depending on how you use the game, we may collect the following types of information:</p>

  <h3>1. Account information</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Email address</strong> – when you create an account or sign in with email and password.</li>
    <li><strong>Display name and avatar</strong> – the name and avatar you choose to represent yourself in the game.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Gameplay and profile data</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Game progress (e.g. XP, level, wins, losses).</li>
    <li>Match history (e.g. scores, outcomes, date/time of games).</li>
    <li>Friends list and preferred teammates/opponents that you configure in the game.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Technical and usage data</h3>
  <p>
    When you use the game, certain technical information may be collected automatically by
    third-party services we rely on (such as Google Firebase and Google Play), for example:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device information (such as device model, operating system version).</li>
    <li>Approximate location and IP address (as part of normal internet communication).</li>
    <li>Crash reports and basic analytics (e.g., which screens are used, performance data).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Guest play</h3>
  <p>
    You can choose to play as a <strong>guest</strong> without providing an email address.
    In guest mode, some features may be limited, and your data may be stored locally on the device
    or associated with an anonymous identifier rather than an email.
  </p>

  <h2>How we use your information</h2>
  <p>We use the information described above for the following purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account creation and login</strong> – to let you create an account, log in, and manage your profile.</li>
    <li><strong>Saving and syncing progress</strong> – to store your game progress, stats, and match history so they are not lost and can be synced across devices when you sign in.</li>
    <li><strong>Online play</strong> – to create and join online rooms, match you with other players, and show your name/avatar to other players.</li>
    <li><strong>Game features</strong> – to support features such as friends, preferred partner/opponent, and match history.</li>
    <li><strong>Maintenance and improvement</strong> – to understand crashes, performance issues, and overall usage in order to improve the game.</li>
    <li><strong>Security and abuse prevention</strong> – to help protect the game and its users from fraud, cheating, or abuse.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-party services</h2>
  <p>
    Royal Hokm uses third-party services provided by Google, including but not limited to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Firebase Authentication</strong> – for email/password sign-in and guest accounts.</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase Firestore / Realtime Database / Cloud Functions</strong> – to store game data, profiles, online rooms, and match information.</li>
    <li><strong>Other Google Play / Firebase services</strong> – such as analytics and crash reporting (if enabled).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These services process data on our behalf to provide core functionality of the game.
    Their use is governed by their own privacy policies, for example Google’s Privacy Policy,
    which you can review on Google’s official website.
  </p>

  <h2>Data sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal information.
    We may share data only in the following limited situations:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>With service providers such as Google Firebase that host and process data needed to operate the game.</li>
    <li>When required by law, legal process, or to respond to lawful requests from authorities.</li>
    <li>To protect the rights, property, or safety of our users or the public, when permitted by law.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data retention</h2>
  <p>
    We keep your data for as long as necessary to provide the game and its features, and for
    legitimate business and legal purposes. For example, we keep your account and game stats while
    your account remains active. If you request deletion of your account, we will delete or
    anonymize your personal information within a reasonable time, subject to any legal obligations.
  </p>

  <h2>Your choices and rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Play as a guest</strong> – you can play without creating an email-based account, although some features may be limited.</li>
    <li><strong>Update your information</strong> – you can update your display name and avatar inside the game.</li>
    <li><strong>Account deletion</strong> – you can contact us to request deletion of your account and associated data.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Depending on your location, you may have additional rights under local data protection laws
    (for example, rights to access, correct, or delete your data). We will make reasonable efforts
    to honor such requests where required by law.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Royal Hokm is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect
    personal information from children under 13. If you believe that a child has provided us
    with personal information, please contact us and we will take steps to remove the information.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to this privacy policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this privacy policy from time to time, for example to reflect changes in the game,
    our practices, or legal requirements. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at
    the top of this page. Your continued use of the game after changes have been posted
    means you accept those changes.
